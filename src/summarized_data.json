    "content": "NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 1: Former film producer Harvey Weinstein appears at a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court on May 1, 2024 in New York City. This is his first public appearance since the New York State Court of Appeals overturned his 2020 rape conviction on April 25. (Photo by Curtis Means-Pool/Getty Images) Pool via Getty Images \u201cThis story was originally published by THE CITY. Sign up to get the latest New York City news delivered to you each morning.\u201d Harvey Weinstein is being kept in a private room inside Bellevue Hospital\u2019s Intensive Care Unit on a floor away from all other detainees, THE CITY has learned. Advertisement Almost all city detainees with serious medical issues are kept inside the Department of Correction\u2019s medical unit on the 19th floor. But Weinstein currently has his own phone, bathroom, and television \u2014 a perk few, if any, other city detainees are afforded \u2014 in a different location in the hospital. He spends most of his day watching CNN and other television programs and talking in person or on the phone to Arthur Aidala, the attorney handling his appeal. The disgraced movie mogul was moved to the Manhattan public hospital hours after he was brought back to Rikers Island on April 27 when an appeals court tossed his 2020 rape conviction. Weinstein, 72, was transferred to the hospital following complaints of chest pain, according to a jail source familiar with his case. Advertisement He has since been diagnosed with pneumonia, and his legal team says he\u2019s dealing with a host of other serious medical conditions like constant chest and abdominal pain, another jail insider said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sick man,\u201d Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno told THE CITY. \u201cHarvey has multiple health issues and he\u2019s never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody.\u201d A former therapist who worked on Rikers questioned why Weinstein has remained in the ICU for so long, noting he\u2019s capable of shaving, showering, and moving out of bed. \u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to be there,\u201d said the clinician who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cIt\u2019s special treatment.\u201d The city\u2019s Correctional Health Services, which oversees medical care for incarcerated people, did not respond to a request seeking comment. Advertisement Jail officials briefly tried to move Weinstein to the 19th floor unit last week but he was sent back to his room in the ICU, according to the jail sources. The former Hollywood powerbroker is also being watched by four correction officers from the department\u2019s Emergency Service Unit. A former top jail official questioned why he was being watched by four ESU officers. \u201cDoes he need ESU? No. Could two regular officers watch him? Probably. He\u2019s certainly not an escape risk,\u201d said Martin Horn, who served as commissioner of the probation and correction departments during the Bloomberg administration. Struggles to Properly Treat Detainees Most high-profile detainees are housed in the department\u2019s West Facility on Rikers. The jail was originally built to house people with contagious diseases. It is largely empty and detainees placed there, like former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, are typically given their own cells \u2014 away from other people locked up. The city Department of Correction has long struggled to properly treat incarcerated people with complex medical needs. Most are treated at medical clinics located in each of the 10 jail facilities on Rikers. Advertisement The Board of Correction, the city jails\u2019 oversight body, has repeatedly cited missed medical visits as a key factor in deaths behind bars since Mayor Eric Adams took over in January 2022. Most recently, on Friday, the board found that a Rikers detainee who died behind bars earlier this year was without a mattress for 18 hours and only got one outside recreation session in 15 days before he was found unresponsive in his cell. Manuel Luna, 30, was also not brought to a medical clinic to receive methadone eight times from Oct. 25, 2023, through Jan. 12, 2024, according to the Board of Correction. Luna, who was facing charges of stealing an e-bike, was found unresponsive inside his cell in the George R. Vierno Center on Jan. 19. Known as Panda to his friends, he was moved to that new housing area shortly before his death, the Daily News reported . The city Medical Examiner has not determined the cause of the death. Luna was a \u201cloving person\u201d who \u201calways loved to make people laugh,\u201d his brother, Angel Luna, told THE CITY. Advertisement In jail, he and others are \u201cnot being treated like human beings,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t keep people alive, then close the jail down,\u201d he added. \u201cIf a bakery can\u2019t make bread, you close shop. The same for these jails. You can\u2019t keep holding people there. They\u2019re killing people, and they\u2019re going to keep killing people. There is a trail of bodies left behind by the negligence and abuse.\u201d The Department of Correction did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Weinstein\u2019s situation isn\u2019t totally different from those of other detainees in the hospital. The former movie mogul can eat only hospital food and must wear sweats issued by the jail. He was forced to remove a Yankees baseball hat and sweatshirt, according to one of the jail sources. His visitors also must first go to the 19th floor to be screened and searched before they are allowed to meet him, the jail insiders said. But it is still more convenient than the hours-long screening process that takes place on Rikers. Until last month, Weinstein was incarcerated at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles northwest of Albany. He was moved back to city custody after New York\u2019s highest court vacated his conviction, ruling that a trial judge unfairly allowed jurors to see and hear evidence that was not directly related to the charges. The decision tossed his 23-year prison sentence and called for a retrial. Weinstein remains in prison because in 2022 he was convicted of another rape in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.

    "content": "LUMBERTON, N.C. -- A South Carolina pastor's wife shot and killed herself in Robeson County, North Carolina, according to a medical examiner. Dr. Richard Johnson is the Robeson County Medical Examiner. He told the area ABC affiliate that he was at the scene helping the on-call medical examiner on April 27 at Lumbee River State Park. That's when and where the body of 30-year-old Mica Miller was found. She was the wife of John-Paul Miller, the pastor of Solid Rock Church in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Mica's death had been the focus of much speculation since it became known that she had died. Her husband was the first to call Mica's death a suicide. Her friends and family then came forward with questions and concerns about her death. \"We were talking about her coming to church Sunday, getting some help with her car payment, just life stuff -- just her moving forward,\" one of Mica's friends said expressing doubts that she killed herself. Online records show that Mica and John-Paul were in the process of getting a divorce. During the weekend, there were two separate memorials held at the same time to honor Mica's life: one organized by her husband, the other by her friends. In addition, police documents show that Mica \"was afraid for her life\" in the month leading up to her death. The documents show that Mica believed a person was following and watching her, even deflating her tires and pestering her with phone calls. A mechanic reportedly found a tracking device on her car.

    "description": "According to James' lawsuit, the anti-abortion group used false and misleading claims abortion pill reversal treatment.",
    "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James sued an anti-abortion group and 11 crisis pregnancy centers on Monday, accusing them of promoting and \"misleading\" an abortion reversal treatment. Since the U.S. , leaving individual states to choose their legal status on abortion, access to women's health care has waned. While several states have rolled out abortion bans, growing concern over access to contraceptives and abortion continue. According to James' lawsuit, Heartbeat International, an anti-abortion group, and the Crisis Pregnancy Centers allegedly used false and misleading claims in an effort to \"convince pregnant people to get the abortion pill reversal (APR) treatment.\" \"Attorney General James alleges that making false and misleading claims about APR to convince pregnant people to get the treatment constitutes fraud, deceptive business practices, and false advertising under New York law,\" James' office said in a press release emailed to . has reached out to Heartbeat International via email for comment. An APR procedure involves a woman who has changed her mind about aborting a pregnancy after taking mifepristone, the first part of a two-drug regimen used for medication abortion, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to terminate pregnancy in the first 10 weeks. APR involves taking progesterone to offset the effects of mifepristone. However, the course of action has not been approved by the . Additionally, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the method is \"not based on science and do not meet clinical standards.\" On Monday, James took to X, formerly , to announce the lawsuit as she warned of the potential danger the treatment can be as abortions cannot be reversed. \"I'm suing @HeartbeatIntl and 11 crisis pregnancy centers across New York for illegally advertising and promoting an abortion reversal treatment. Abortions cannot be reversed, and this treatment could be incredibly dangerous,\" James wrote on X. According to the lawsuit, the crisis pregnancy centers throughout the state advertise the abortion pill reversal method on their websites and through social media. James alleges that some of the centers \"appear to offer or facilitate APR treatment on-site at their offices, while others direct people to obtain APR treatment through Heartbeat's Abortion Pill Rescue Network.\" \"Abortions cannot be reversed. Any treatments that claim to do so are made without scientific evidence and could be unsafe,\"James said in a statement. \"Heartbeat International and the other crisis pregnancy center defendants are spreading dangerous misinformation by advertising 'abortion pill reversal' without any medical and scientific proof. \"Amid the increase in attacks on reproductive health care nationwide, we must protect pregnant people's right to make safe, well-informed decisions about their health. Your reproductive health care decisions are yours and yours alone, and my office will always protect New Yorkers from those who push a scientifically unproven and potentially life-threatening intervention.\" James' lawsuit comes after a lawsuit was filed against her over her attempts to stop pregnancy crisis organizations from providing \"persistent misleading statements\" about the APR methods. The coalition of anti-abortion groups, represented by the Thomas More Society\u2014a conservative law firm based in Chicago\u2014accused James of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" and violating their First Amendment rights after she sent multiple \"Notice of Intention to Sue\" letters to multiple pregnancy centers calling on them to stop providing \"persistent misleading statements.\" The groups' lawsuit says that James' office is violating the constitutional rights of the pregnancy help organizations by preventing them from promoting APR and are suing her office to prevent any potential future prosecution. \"New York State laws protect abortionists and abortion on demand up until birth. Now they are targeting those who assist a woman in exercising her right to continue her own pregnancy,\" Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International, one of several anti-abortion groups named as plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement.

    "content": "I am a concerned community member of the state of Alaska and wanted to share my thoughts in a short letter. I work with people who are experiencing substance abuse addiction. They come to our facility broken and full of shame because they are stigmatized and thrown away by society. This stigma prevents them from feeling worthy of asking for help so only ten percent of them do. We are losing one person to opioids every 11 minutes in this country, and it will only get worse. I don\u2019t have all the answers. But I get to know some of these people and, after they do some healing and have someone who cares help them, I get a glimpse into who they truly are and what their potential could be. I just want to put this out there. Even if it makes one person think and decide to help in some small way, it\u2019s worth it. If we put just 10% of the time we use judging, criticizing, and policing addicts and put that into collective community care for each other and the most marginalized we could make real change. So the next time you judge someone experiencing a substance addiction, remember we all have our addictions. We all use something to numb our pain, whether it\u2019s an addiction to social media, working, shopping or drugs and alcohol. Collective community care will help those already addicted and prevent more from becoming addicted. You can search online to learn more. \u2014 Simone Smith Seward Have something on your mind?

Continue reading \"SwitchArcade Round-Up: Reviews Featuring \u2018El Shaddai\u2019 & \u2018Class of Heroes\u2019, Plus the Latest Releases and Sales\"",
    "content": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for May 6th, 2024. In today\u2019s article, we start off our week with a few reviews. I take a look at , and , three very different releases that each have their own quirks. After that, we head into the new releases of the day, and as usual for a Monday they\u2019re bin-heavy. We finish things up in the usual fashion with the lists of new and expiring sales, and they\u2019re not too shabby this time. Let\u2019s get to it! Despite the bright and fluffy anime vibe the games give off, it behooves one to keep in mind that these games were developed by Zero Div, a company most known for porting arcade shooters and making some of the Japanese entries in the series. The shooter thing isn\u2019t too important here, but that bit is vital. These games are just as ruthless and brutal as , and about as cumbersome to navigate as the Zero Div-developed . Indeed, there\u2019s a solid chance you\u2019ll get yourself killed in the tutorial dungeon if you\u2019re not careful, and recovering from death isn\u2019t an easy process. If that doesn\u2019t turn you off, then you might be ready to attend these classes. You get two games here, essentially the newest versions of the first two games in the series. These were originally PSP games, and they certainly feel like it. The first game was localized by Atlus back in the day while the second came to the West in its PlayStation 3 guise via the short-lived Gaijinworks, and it seems like those scripts weren\u2019t available to PQube because we have new localizations for both games. Unfortunately, they\u2019re a little on the poor side, with lots of typos and generally awkward phrasing throughout both titles. Well, these games aren\u2019t really known for their stories anyway. If you\u2019re patient enough to digest all of the tutorials and can tolerate some serious setbacks at times, both of these games offer a deep and satisfying dungeon-crawling RPG experience. The second game expands even further on the already rich character building options from the first, and figuring out how to make a winning party is a decent time in both games. But I must again caution that these games aren\u2019t for the tame of heart. A single bad-luck encounter can leave you in a position that can be very difficult to dig out of, and there are a lot more ways to fail than there are to succeed. If you want a friendlier dungeon RPG experience, I\u2019d recommend the games instead. A certain type of player is going to love , but it\u2019s important to keep in mind what these games are and aren\u2019t. They\u2019re fundamentally not all that different from their original PSP incarnations, and the new localizations aren\u2019t great. Beginners will want to proceed with caution, as despite the colorful look and school theme these are extremely unforgiving experiences. If you feel like modern dungeon crawlers aren\u2019t nasty enough or just miss the friction of the classic games, this is going to be right up your alley. is a hard game to review because the things that make it good are largely intangible. I mean, yes, it is artistically gorgeous. Even all these years later, with the polygon models looking a lot less impressive, this game is a looker. Its team was led by a former Capcom artist who worked on , and you can feel the artist\u2019s eye on every scene of the game. The story is way out there, with just enough ideas packed into it that it\u2019s both fascinating and constantly in danger of falling up its own hindquarters. The gameplay is merely adequate, like a watered-down take on . On paper, I shouldn\u2019t have enjoyed this as much as I did. But there was just something about the way all of its quirky aspects came together, and I ended up playing through the whole game in just a few (admittedly lengthy) sessions. I wanted to see what happened next in the story, but more than that I wanted to see what interesting visual treats were waiting for me next. I was less excited to see what gameplay challenges awaited me, and in that regard my lack of enthusiasm was a wise choice. never really finds its footing with its action mechanics, cruising through with the bare minimum. And I think how you feel about that is ultimately going to be where you come down on , which even in its Switch form feels very much like the plucky 2011 passion project that it is. has always been a game that divided opinions, and that\u2019s just as true of this HD remaster as it was for the original version. The beautiful presentation carries a lot of the load here, and the story certainly has its charms. The repetitive gameplay is the biggest issue here, as it fails to offer both the diversity of moves and expanding arsenal of many of its peers in the character action genre. For me, the good outweighed the inadequate here, and nothing was really outright bad about it. But if you think a game needs to get by on its mechanics, you might want to pump the brakes on this . First up, I\u2019ll say that if you don\u2019t have ready access to other players for local multiplayer, don\u2019t bother with this. Those playing solo will only have access to a small fraction of the game\u2019s content, and there\u2019s no online play here. It\u2019s a shame about the latter in particular, because it really does narrow the audience for this one. Anyway, you have a variety of modes to play here, but in the main the gameplay mechanics are similar across them. You\u2019re a little blob without much offensive skill but a fair amount of speed and agility. You pick up weapons that stick to you, and they\u2019ll make you bigger and slower. The more weapons you grab, the better armed you are. But you\u2019re also a larger target for everyone else, so you need to keep that in mind. Again, various goals across various modes, but blowing up the other players won\u2019t go wrong for you. Get the requisite people in place for the four-player local multiplayer, and is pretty fun. It gets a little repetitive after a short while, but as long as you play it in managed bursts there are good times to be had here. I feel like the core concept isn\u2019t quite as balanced as it should be, but growing to be a giant blob with guns sticking out of every bit of your bloated body is enjoyable enough that you might not care. Popping another player who has hit that size and stealing all their artillery is definitely a good feeling. There\u2019s something to this game, even if it doesn\u2019t quite stick together the way one might hope. Well, I suppose it\u2019s exactly what it says on the tin, isn\u2019t it? A remake of the modest 2008 indie RPG, it offers 3D visuals and a new difficulty setting to play on. Not the fanciest of dinners, but I\u2019m sure for a fiver you\u2019re not expecting a roast turkey with all the trimmings. It might entertain you for an evening or two, and I think that\u2019s sufficient for what it\u2019s asking. This sequel to is another side-scrolling action game, but this time it leans more heavily into being a parody. You\u2019ve got the same cast of characters more or less, with a few new faces joining them. Swap between them as needed or preferred to deal with the enemies in your way as you battle your way through the Vampire Lord\u2019s castle. If you enjoyed the first, you should have a good time with this game. Here\u2019s another point-and-click style adventure game with its Lucasarts love boldly positioned upon its sleeve. It\u2019s a decent one, too. Time travel plus multiple playable characters obviously evokes the likes of , and it\u2019s always risky to invite comparisons to legends like that. isn\u2019t as good as that game, of course, but it carries itself well outside of a few pacing issues. Fans of the genre will want to give it a look. May the sixth be with you! Over the course of the weekend, some sales popped up. Most of the games on the Switch are pretty good, so pick up whatever you think looks good. Beyond that, DotEmu is having another sale on its excellent games, and there are other assorted goodies like , and to consider. There isn\u2019t too much in the outbox, but take a look at it anyway.

We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more reviews, more new games, more sales, and perhaps some news. The holidays are finally wrapping up here in Japan, but I worked the whole way through anyway so it doesn\u2019t matter much for me. I hope you all have a marvelous Monday, and as always, thanks for reading!",

    "content": "Ukrainian army 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade serviceman Vitalii sits next to artillery ammunition as he waits for orders with his unit, in Avdiivka direction, Ukraine, Monday, May 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco) Russia on Monday threatened to strike British military facilities and said it would hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid sharply rising tensions over comments by senior Western officials about possibly deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine. After summoning the British ambassador to the Foreign Ministry, Moscow warned that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.K.-supplied weapons could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere. The remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The drills are a response to \u201cprovocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\u201d the Defense Ministry said in a statement. It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons \u2014 massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently. \u201cCurrent nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\u201d Dujarric said. \u201cAll actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\u201d The Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine\u2019s Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin\u2019s forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine\u2019s shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine\u2019s Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn\u2019t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv\u2019s forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility. The Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron\u2019s recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills. \u201cIt\u2019s a new round of escalation,\u201d Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \u201cto think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\u201d Sweden\u2019s Foreign Minister Tobias Billstro\u0308m said the nuclear exercises \u201ccontribute to increasing instability.\u201d \u201cIn the current security situation, Russia\u2019s actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\u201d Billstro\u0308m told Swedish news agency TT. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council that\u2019s chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \u201cglobal catastrophe.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Europe\u2019s military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.\u2019s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus. The ministry said the exercise is intended to \u201cincrease the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\u201d and will be held on Putin\u2019s orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said. The Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \u201cNuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin\u2019s regime; it does not constitute major news.\u201d Western officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance\u2019s soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat. Peskov dismissed those claims as \u201cnew, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\u201d Germany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s party. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv\u2019s forces in recent months. One of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. It was not possible to independently confirm the report. While Ukraine\u2019s army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. In what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine\u2019s power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine\u2019s northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said. Russia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine\u2019s air force said.",
